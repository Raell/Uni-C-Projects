Please compile with 'gcc -std=c99 ap\&gp.c -lm -o ap\&gp' to link code with math lib to ensure the math functions will work properly.

The program allows you to generate the set containing the Arithmetic Progression or Geometric Progression of any given parameters. It generates the n-th term of the sequence along with the sum of all first n numbers and prints the first n sequences of the set. It also gives a limit of the infinite geometric sequence if possible.

The program can accept any double value positive and negative, including fractions seperated by '/' as parameters where appropriate.
